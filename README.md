# The AUV Project

The AUV Project is an attempt at simulating an autonomous underwater vehicle simulation. The pipeline is a combination of a signal processing, an imaging-pipeline and a perception & control pipeline. The project was inspired by Northrop Grumman's [Manta Ray Project](https://www.northropgrumman.com/what-we-do/mission-solutions/sensors/manta-ray). 

The aim of this project is to create a surveillance AUV designed to surveil sea-floor despite presence of obstructive terrain-features, sans human-intervention. 

**Notes**:
- The project is lowkey low priority, so its gonna be a while. 
- The primary implementation will be in C++, with a custom templated-library ([svr-library](https://github.com/vrsreeganesh/svr)) LibTorch.

## Getting Started

Visit the Holoscan User Guide to get started with the Holoscan SDK: <https://docs.nvidia.com/holoscan/sdk-user-guide/getting_started.html>

The Holoscan User Guide includes:
- An introduction to the NVIDIA Holoscan platform, including the Holoscan C++/Python SDK;
- Requirements and setup steps;
- Detailed SDK documentation, including a developer introduction, examples, and API details.

We also recommend visiting [NVIDIA HoloHub](https://github.com/nvidia-holoscan/holohub) to view
community projects and reusable components available for your Holoscan project.

## Obtaining the Holoscan SDK

The Holoscan User Guide documents several options to install and run the Holoscan SDK:

- As an [NGC Container 🐋](https://docs.nvidia.com/holoscan/sdk-user-guide/sdk_installation.html#sd-tab-item-2)
- As a [Debian Package 📦️](https://docs.nvidia.com/holoscan/sdk-user-guide/sdk_installation.html#sd-tab-item-3)
- As a [Python Wheel 🐍](https://docs.nvidia.com/holoscan/sdk-user-guide/sdk_installation.html#sd-tab-item-4)

Visit the [Holoscan User Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/holoscan/sdk-user-guide/sdk_installation.html#not-sure-what-to-choose) for
guidance to help choose which installation option may be right for your use case.

If the options above do not support your use case, you may prefer to [build the SDK from source](./DEVELOP.md).

Please review [Holoscan SDK prerequisites](https://docs.nvidia.com/holoscan/sdk-user-guide/sdk_installation.html#prerequisites)
before getting started.

## Troubleshooting and Feedback

We appreciate community discussion and feedback in support of Holoscan platform users and developers. We ask that users:
- Review the [Holoscan SDK Frequently Asked Questions](FAQ.md) document for common solutions and workarounds.
- Direct questions to the [NVIDIA Support Forum](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/c/healthcare/holoscan-sdk/320/all).
- Enter SDK issues on the [SDK GitHub Issues board](https://github.com/nvidia-holoscan/holoscan-sdk/issues).

## Contributing to Holoscan SDK

Holoscan SDK is developed internally and released as open source software. We welcome community contributions
and may include them in Holoscan SDK releases at our discretion. Please refer to the Holoscan SDK
[Contributing Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information. -->
